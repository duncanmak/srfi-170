Fixup error handling per reversion + enhancements:

- Maybe incorporate procedure string name in message as opposed to a
  seperate record field


Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

Clean up post-set testing etc. of without-echo tty procedure to match
(commented out but previously working) with-raw-mode

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

WRT to above, in general, a great deal of cleanup can be done, this
project was my (hga's) reintrodution to using Scheme in anger after
many decades, and my introduction to Chibi Scheme and its extremely
nifty autogenerating FFI (170.stub).
