HTML: if real-path gets removed, remove "Scsh does not support the
real-path procedure." in implimentation.

Revert perms and current-directory changes towards being parameters

Fixup error handling per reversion + enhancements:

- Create disjoint exception type "srfi-error" for errors we catch
- Return failing procedure called as a string instead of a procedure object
- Turn the procedure object into errno-procedure-obj
- Maybe incorporate above in message as opposed to a seperate record field
- Add name of the system or library call that failed to error-errno
- Add errno define name to message string
- Add test-group for 3.1


Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

Clean up post-set testing etc. of with- and without- tty procedures
to match with-raw-mode

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.
