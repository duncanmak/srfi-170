Fixup error handling per reversion + enhancements:

- Add name of the system or library call that failed to error-errno
- Add errno define name to message string
- Create disjoint exception type "srfi-error" for errors we catch
- Maybe incorporate procedure string name in message as opposed to a seperate record field


Needed to match the SRFI:

Catch exceptions raised by 170.stub wrappers and turn into SRFI errors
and/or catch them all before calling the stub wrappers

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

Clean up post-set testing etc. of without-echo tty procedure to match
(commented out but previously working) with-raw-mode

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.
