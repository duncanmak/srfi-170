Fixup error handling per reversion + enhancements:

- Add name of the system or library call that failed to error-errno

- Create disjoint exception type "srfi-error" for errors we catch

- Maybe incorporate procedure string name in message as opposed to a seperate record field

- Search for which stubs raise exceptions vs. doing the errno #f FFI trick

- Document, or catch exceptions raised by 170.stub wrappers and turn
  into SRFI errors and/or catch them all before calling the stub
  wrappers


Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub
(in general, a great deal of cleanup can be done, this project was my
reintrodution to using Scheme in anger after decades, and my
introduction to Chibi Scheme and its nifty autogenerating FFI.

Clean up post-set testing etc. of without-echo tty procedure to match
(commented out but previously working) with-raw-mode

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.
